# TensorDock Marketplace Install

This is the code that hosts should run when they add a new machine to the TensorDock Marketplace. Contact your TensorDock account manager for the latest, most up-to-date instructions; this script is a periodically updated version of our internal code, so it may be out of date. 

## Installing our software
To use this, clone this Git repository and run the install script. 
```git clone https://github.com/tensordock/marketplace-install
cd marketplace-install
sudo bash install.sh```

During the process, it'll ask you to confirm to install some packages. Here, respond "Y" for yes. 

It will also ask you for your network device. Network devices can be something along the lines of `enp4so, eth0, ens1, etc.` 
Please copy and paste the network device information from another open session; it is easy to confuse the number one ("1") with a lowercase L ("l"), for example.
